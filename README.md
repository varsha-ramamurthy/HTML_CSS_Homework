# HTML_CSS_Homework
- HTML visualization of Python API Homework utilizing CSS and Bootstrap
- The goal of this homework assignment was to create a website showing climate data in different cities across the world and compare climatic properties (city temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) with the latitude of the respective city. Each web-page showed the data visualization of these comparisons, and also tabulated these numbers.

## Steps Taken to Complete Homework
- The graphs from the Python API homework were obtained and saved in an images folder
- A home page was created describing the purpose of the project and containing links to each visualization and comparison
- The following web-pages made up the website aside from the home page:
    1. Latitude vs. Temperature
    2. Latitude vs. Humidity
    3. Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    4. Latitude vs. Wind Speed
    5. Latitude vs. x (x= Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed)
    6. A data tabulation of each climatic property of each city
-The website and web-pages were formatted accordingly using bootstrap and css (see "style.css")
- A link to the Python API project was also included in the home page
